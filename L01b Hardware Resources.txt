After that fun review of the power of abstractions, next we will take a
look at the hardware resources being managed by the operating system.

As we will see, one of the operating system's role is to control access of the
applications to physical hardware. So a basic understanding
of hardware components and how they interact is
essential to the course. Let's do a quick
review. What better way to start the review
than by a fun quiz. Now in this
quiz, I'm showing you the hardware continuum that exists
today in terms of the devices that you and I are using on an everyday basis.
Smartphones all the way to the cloud and
a lot of data points inbetween. There are tablet's,
and laptops. There are desktop computers. There are
servers. And of course, the cloud computing itself that
you may have heard of, that is being
enabled by data centers. So this is a hardware
continuum that you're looking at. And the question that I'm posing to
you is, is the internal organization of computer system in this continuum,
going all the way from smartphone to the cloud. Is this vastly
different? That's the question. And it's a binary answer. Yes or no.

### Video 03

The right answer is no, and since this might seem a bit counterintuitive
given this huge range of the hardware continuum, let's reason
it out. Basically, the hardware inside a computer
system consists of the processor, memory. And
implode the devices. And the organization of these hardware elements
within the computer system, whether we are talking about
smart phone or cloud, is not going to change tremendously.

So we have this hardware continuum from cell phones and PDAs to laptops,
to tablet's, to desktop computers, all the way to nodes in
a data center that is providing cloud computing services. Regardless of these
different manifestations and sizes, the organization
of the hardware inside the computer
system is pretty much the same. You've got a CPU. And the CPU is connected to
a conduit, which we call the bus. And
you've got memory that has the instructions and
data that is needed for the CPU to execute. And the CPU can use it's conduit,
namely the bus, to access the memory. And
you need storage for persistance of files and
other data that your produce during the computation. And, once again the CPU can
access stuff on the student's device through
a controller that is also connected to
this conduit. And you may have other peripheral devices, like a microphone and a
camera. All of these devices, of course,
are accessible for the CPU through this conduit,
which is the bus. And of course in this day, and age a device has to be
able to communicate with the outside world. You have a network, and once again
the network is interfaced through a controller to the CPU via
this conduit. So this conduit for communication Which is the BUS,
serves the purpose of connecting the CPU to the
memory as well as all the iode devices that
it may need to interact with in order to
do whatever the intent is of the user and
the application that they want to run on the
computer. And depending on the sophistication of the device
that we're talking about, and the speed of the
device that we're talking about. These controllers that I'm
showing you may have different capabilities. So for instance a
network controller may have the ability to
move the data directly from the memory into
the network, or from the network into the
memory and this As you may have learned
in a computer organization course, is called direct
memory access for the controller to move data
swiftly between memory and the IO device. And
similar DMA facility may exist in the controllers
of other high speed devices, this is the high
speed device. So that's the capability that you got
for some of these controllers. Some of these controllers
may be slow enough, for instance a keyboard or
a mouse, that the CPU can directly query new
data that is coming from the controller that is
associated with slow speed devices, and move it into
memory or use it in any fashion that it wants.

Here are the more elaborate organization of the hardware resources inside a
computer system with an I/O Bus and a system Bus, and usually the system
Bus, is a synchronous communication device between the CPU and the memory.
The I/O bus is primarily intended for the devices to communicate with the CPU.
And the intent is that the individual needs of each of these devices, in terms
of the communication bandwidth that they may need,
is less than the cumulative bandwidth that may
be available for the CPU to communicate with
the memory. Or in other words, the system
bus has a communication bandwidth that is much
more than the communication bandwidth that's available in
the I/O bus. So the system bus is a high speed bus and it connects via a bridge
to the I/O bus. And this bridge itself, could be a specialized IO processor
for scheduling the devices that need to communicate
with the memory for instance, if it is
a DMA device or need to communicate with the CPU if it's a slow speed device.
So the role of the bridge is like a processor in itself. Controlling
who has access to this I/O bus among the set of devices that
maybe competing at the same time for attention by the CPU and
communicating the intent of these I/O devices either directly with
the memory or via the CPU. The I/O bus is typically lower speed
than the higher speed system bus. And the cumulative
bandwidth that is needed in the system bus is
usually much higher because it has to cater to
all the clients that may want to access the
memory, either from the CPU or from any of
these devices coming through this bridge. There may be
other high-speed devices, for example, a frame buffer, of
a graphics display that may also be hanging off of
the system bus due to the need for refreshing the screen in a rapid manner from
the memory. So in a nut shell, if you look at the internal organization of a
computer system that are going to be one or
more CPUs, whether it is a single-core machine
or multi-core machine or parallel machine and so
on. You're going to have one or more CPUs and
youre going to have a bunch of memory that the CPUs can access and there's
going to be a whole number of input-output devices. And device controllers that
allow these devices to communicate with the CPU, or
directly with the memory. And there are conduits, system bus and I/O bus,
for connecting these controllers to the CPU as well as
to the memory. Basically, these conduits allow ferrying data from the CPU to the
devices, or from the devices to the CPU, and between CPU and the memory,
as well as from the devices to the memory. This is why I mentioned
earlier that there is no difference in
the organization, regardless of the platform specifics,
the form factor may be different, or the intended use may be different
of a particular platform. But the internal
organization is pretty much going to look as
I've shown you here in terms of the hardware elements that are going to be
there as well as the connectivity that
you might see among these hardware elements.

The specifics, such as the computational power,
the memory capacity, and the number and
types of input, output of devices, may vary from one manifestation of a computer
system, to the next. For example, commensurate
with it's intended use, a cell phone
or a pda may have very limited
input/output capabilities such as a graphics display,
speakers and microphones. But on the other hand, a high end supercomputer
used for running large scale scientific applications may employ thousands
of CPUs, incorporate several terabytes of memory and be connected
an array of disks with storage capacities on the order of several parabytes.

In summary then, the organization of a
computer system is consistent enough that many of
the key operating system concepts apply to all
of them regardless of size and capacity. On
the other hand, these differences should not
be ignored and advances in hardware have helped
drive innovation in operating systems, so that we
can get the most out of their capabilities.
